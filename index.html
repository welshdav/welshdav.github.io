                <p>I am a Fullstack Web Development Professional based in Chicago Illinois. I have experience ranging in everything from Website Development to Mobile Apps. <br>
                To me, the experience is the important part. The "Fun Part" is designing the ser flow and asking "What are they going to get out of this?" "What need will this fulfill in thier lives?"<br>
                "What is the user going to feel when they exit this program?" That's the fun of the development process for me, and is who I am as a developer.</p>
