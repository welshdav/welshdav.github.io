  <h4>Project Details</h4>
  <p>The Fair Lumber Project was an extremely basic development job. Almost too simple, as all that was requested was a back to basics favicon, and homepage.</p>
  <p>The client directed me to set up a very basic Wordpress website. The interesting thing about this project was realizing how heavily I rely on being able to directly access the CSS and ID elements for rudimentary design work.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://codepen.io/welshdav/pen/JqrLQE">The CodePen</a></h3>
  <p>The above codepen is a rough idea of how I would've gone about the project if I'd been able to develop and deploy via AWS EC2, along with using some of the pictures in this file </p>
