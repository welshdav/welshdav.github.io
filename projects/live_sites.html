  <h4>Project Details</h4>
  <p>The Fair Lumber Project was an extremely basic development job. Almost too simple, as all that was requested was a back to basics favicon, and homepage.</p>
  <p>The client directed me to set up a very basic Wordpress website. The interesting thing about this project was realizing how heavily I rely on being able to directly access the CSS and ID elements for rudimentary design work.</p>
