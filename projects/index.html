<p><b>Why start this?</b></p>
<br>

<p>There are hundreds, if not thousands of Food blogs in the city of Chicago. Hell, there’s probably a food blog for everything down to “who serves the best chilled craft beer in Lakeview.” The answer is the Whole Foods on the corner of Lincoln Ave and Addison, the beverage director being one of the most interesting people in the city. </p>

<p>The real purpose of this is a selfish one. It’s a Food and Wine Website that serves as an internal application for my company, Grant Place Designs, and as a justification for me and my business partner to go out to have a good dinner, drink good beer, wine, and spirits. To Tom’s credit, he’s both a wine and cocktail enthusiast. Whereas I once spent a month staging in Michelin Stared restaurants to determine if I wanted to go into the culinary industry. Our quota will be to post a custom cocktail, $30 and under wine review, and restaurant review weekly. </p>

<p>As it should be noted, the point of this upcoming blog is to have fun. The first post to this site will be from the celebration dinner for the creation of our little firm, and at a place that has the great honor of being the most affordable Michelin Stared Restaurant in Chicago. “Dusek’s Beer and Board”. </p>
